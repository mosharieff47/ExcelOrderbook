# Excel Coinbase Pro Orderbook Monitor

## Description
This is a Python powered Excel spreadsheet which uses the library XLWings to automate processes in Excel. I imported the live level 2 orderbook from Coinbase Pro for several crypto-currencies and generate the output into the spreadsheet. There is a conditional formatting feature on the volume of each row of the book to give a relative understanding on which ticks have the largest volume in them. Additionally I used a Support Vector Machine to classify whether one should Buy or Sell along with a probability that the classification is correct.
